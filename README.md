A library management toolkit to keep track of all my books

Myself, my wife, and my parents are all avid book collectors. And we all have different tastes in what we like to read; yours truly loves 
non fiction, mathematics, and science. My wife goes more towards high fantasy and YA novels (which she also routinely writes). My 
father is all things fiction, and my mother has quite the eclectic taste. As a result, our collected library is diverse and massive, and 
keeping track of what we have and what we want is hugely complicated. This tool aims to remedy that complexity.

This project is built with the tacit understanding that software like this already exists out there in the world. However, it's either 
paid software, or is freeware that harvests my information to sell to advertisers; either way, not a fan. Furthermore, this is very much a 
practice exercise. It helps to have a project to work on as you learn things like UX development, database development and implementation, 
API integration, and so on.
